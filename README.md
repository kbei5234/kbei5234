Hi! My name is Karen Bei and I'm a senior at Tufts University studying Computer Engineering. 

**Internship Experience: **
This past summer, I interned at Thundersoft where I contributed to their accelerated relaunch plans for RubikPI. I built a procedure to demonstrate camera functionality and ran stress tests on various OS images. I leveraged my Mandarin Chinese skills to communicate ideas with my coworkers and become more involved in all the relaunch aspects. Furthermore, I designed a CNN-LSTM model to predict intoxicated states on drunk drivers that had 1.25% variation in an internship project from the automotive sector. 

**Past Projects: **
Through Break Through Tech AI at MIT, I presented at Cadence Design Systems a CNN classification project that predicted with 92% accuracy the validity of PCB Designs. With the Tufts Cybersecurity Clinic, I also proposed two policies to our partner non-profit organization to enhance decrease their attack surface and safeguard confidential data. 

**Relevant Coursework: **
Embedded Systems, Computer Organization, Operating Systems, Data Structures, Digital Logic

**Programming Langauges: **
C, C++, Python, Java, VHDL, Assembly

Interests: Embedded Systems, Digital Logic, Cybersecurity, Machine Learning

Clubs and Commitments: IEEE (President), IEEE HKN (Secretary), Varsity Fencing
